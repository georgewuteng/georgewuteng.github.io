    I am an extremely avid teacher of all ages and skill levels. I have been teaching since fourteen years old, either as a student's primary instructor,
    or a supplementary tutor, and it represents one of the strongest passions of my life.<br><br>

    I believe the objective of instructing music lies in the shared enjoyment of an activity which not only brings joy,
    but stimulates the mind, body, and spirit. I love spending time creating specific curricula that matches what each of
    my students is interested in, and what might help them achieve their musical goals, be it improvising to a song they enjoy,
    preparing for a competition, or harmonising voices of YouTube videos. My pupils range from
    complete beginners, to experienced pianists looking to hone their craft prior to auditions, to adult learners seeking to broaden
    their appreciation of classical music.<br><br>
    
    I also have a particular interest in working with those with learning disabilities; I have taught numerous pupils
    with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder ranging from the ages of six-to-twenty, and have seen and felt the effect
    teaching music has with them.<br><br>
