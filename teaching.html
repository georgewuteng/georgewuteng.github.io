           I am an extremely avid teacher of all ages and skill levels. I have been teaching since I was around fourteen years old, either as a student's primary instructor, or a supplementary tutor, and it is one of the few activities in life that I consistently love.<br><br>
            
           I don't believe the objective of instructing music has anything inherently to do with "becoming a professional musician," nor with "playing the piano well," rather a shared enjoyment of an activity that brings almost everyone joy. I love spending time creating specific curricula that matches what each of my students is interested in, and what might help them achieve their musical goals, be it improvising to a song they enjoy, auditioning for a conservatory, or harmonising voices of YouTube videos.<br><br>
            
            I also have a particular interest in working with those with learning disabilities; I have taught children with ADHD and autism, and have seen and felt the effect teaching music has with them.<br><br>
            
            I would include a translation of this short blurb in French, but, very unfortunately, my French is not at a fluent level, and to include one in my section on "teaching" would belie the fact that, as of now, I am only able to give lessons in English, lest I completely misconstrue a fundamental concept and cause years of confusion... (If, however, one was to offer French lessons in exchange for piano lessons... this would be an extremely enticing offer!)<br><br>
            
            Please do not hesitate to contact me for a trial lesson, which I give free of charge.<br><br>
