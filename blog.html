            Finished practicing at the faculty today, and, you know, was once again reminded 
            of how much better my overall mental hygiene is when I practice on a "real" grand piano,
            as opposed to a digital one, or even an upright. Not really sure why I somehow manage to
            forget this simple fact with such frequency; regardless, it'll be nice next semester when
            things are more or less returning to normalcy, and almost all of my practicing will be
            done in these practice rooms.
            <br><br>
            Deafheaven released a new single recently, and I somehow hadn't listened to it prior to
            today. I'm a little torn on the clean vocals, and an overall blandness, but I still have high
            hopes for this next album as their songwriting is still the best in any black metal band 
            making music these days (YOU CAN QUOTE ME).
            <br><br>
            Also extremely disappointed Tsitsipas couldn't upend Djokovic at Roland Garros; really stunning
            match regardless. Another also: where is Kyrgios? (I know of his reasons for not participating
            in many tournaments during "these times," and also find it hilarious that another reason he gave
            for sitting out the French Open was that he just "doesn't like clay.") Watching Djokovic v. Tsitsipas
            may finally get me to watch Borg v. McEnroe, that 2017 movie. Something about more-or-less-cookie-cutter
            sports dramas always get to me.
            <br><br>
            To See the Next Part of the Dream, by Parannoul, is finally on Spotify. Go listen to it. And here's
            a poem I was reminded of when sending some poems I really like to a friend of mine:
            <br><br>
            <i>Advice for Horsemen<br>by Michael Earl Craig</i><br><br>
            When trying to catch a horse it helps if you look away.<br>
            Eye contact just pisses them off.<br>
            But you can’t fake looking away, horses<br>
            know when you are doing this.<br>
            You have to really look away.<br>
            Some horsemen never come out of  this.
