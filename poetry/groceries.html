            <b>while shopping for groceries</b><br><br>
            i saw someone while shopping for groceries who looked a little disheveled and lost;<br>
first they stared at something in the frozen foods aisle,<br>
then they moved to a large stack of “blue monkey pure coconut water.”<br>
beside the large stack was an employee of the grocery store, which is called “segal’s market.”<br>
the disheveled looking person turned to the employee person and said:<br>
“have you tried this brand of coconut water?<br>
“do you like coconut water? i want to try this brand,<br>
“it’s very cheap here, but i don’t know if it tastes good, have you tried it?”
