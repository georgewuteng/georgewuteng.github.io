            <b>does anyone want to go biking with me?</b><br><br>
           a lot of you, i need, like, twenty of you, here’s the game plan:<br>
we go to one of those bixi stations<br>
and we just rent every single bike,<br>
all of them,<br>
just take every single one of them off the rack.<br>
next top, PROVIGO, we’re getting the hits, we’re talkin:<br>
-mountain dew<br>
-lemon ice pops<br>
-ketchup-flavoured lays chips<br><br>

then we’re gonna bike while sucking on the ice pops and chugging the mountain dew,<br>
not in any particular direction,<br>
just biking for a while.<br>
someone will have a bluetooth speaker playing happy-sounding music.<br>
the sun will be just about to set or maybe already setting.<br>
we’ll have to be respectful of traffic but not so respectful that we’re nervous
and we’ll take turns with who leads the pack and every few minutes we’ll switch off in a well-configured system.<br>
the wind’s gonna whip all around us and it’ll be hard to talk but if we shout loud enough i think we’ll be able to hear each other fine.<br>
nobody is allowed to cut anyone else off and if we’re passing anyone to get closer to someone else we’re trying to talk to we have to shout “ON YOUR LEFT” really loudly and then pass on their left.<br><br>

when we’re all tired we’ll park the bikes and sit in some park.<br>
through an elaborate rocks-papers-scissors marathon tournament one person will be crowned the victor.<br>
they’ll have to take our cash, because we’re all paying equally, and go to a dep and bring back a 24-pack of cider or beer and cinnamon rolls and pretzels.<br>
then we’ll keep sitting in the park drinking them because montreal has an open-bottle policy in public places as long as there’s food because then it qualifies as a “picnic” and it’s not illegal anymore.<br>
someone will rip up grass and let it blow away.<br>
someone else will sigh a little and look at something and say,<br>
“hey, look, guys, guys,<br>
oh my god, look at that dog”<br>
the sun will be almost finished setting at this point and the sky will look like burnt peanut butter.<br>
the sky will look like creamy amber and caramelized onions.
