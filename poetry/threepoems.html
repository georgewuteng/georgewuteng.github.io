            <b>three poems</b><br><br>
            <b>a thought i had today</b><br>
i had a thought today that i might,<br>
like,<br>
start writing poems that make no sense.<br>
i was like, “yeah, this is going to be good, yeah.”<br>
poems that aren’t about anything and don’t go anywhere,<br>
that don’t follow any causal flow,<br>
that are unexplainable, strange, <br>
that don’t mean anything.<br>
<br><br>
            <b>a thing i really like to do</b><br>
a thing i really like to do is:<br>
when i shower, i’ll cross my arms across my chest,<br>
and use them to collect water,<br>
sort of like a gutter without any downspout.<br>
then, after i’ve accumulated enough water,<br>
i uncross my arms.<br>
the water lands like, “WHUMP,” really loud against the base of my tub.<br><br>

            <b>untitled</b><br>
behind this building on campus are these clusters of dumpsters<br>
like, those construction dumpsters that are metal and open-topped and taller than most people and<br>
pretty long<br>
beside these dumpsters are discarded wastes, on the ground, like:<br>
emptied beer cans, weathered receipts, and torn clothing
